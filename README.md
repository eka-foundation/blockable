# blockable
An user-experience API with a radical new vision for human-information interaction. 

### fundamental element of abstraction
The primary object of abstraction is a block. All kinds of interactions with an information system are represented as blocks.

A block represents an action or a sequence of actions. Fundamentally speaking, a block encapsulates arbitrary computer codes. 

### fundamental properties of blocks

Each block in their empty state are identical with each other and can be modified to have properties in 5 degrees of depth. Each degree of depth introduces more complexity. 

**DEGREE 1: color**

The most simple degree of property is the color of the block. For example, in a system focused on simplifying complex data analytics workflows, the color may represent a type of process (e.g. data transformation). 

**DEGREE 2: iconography**

More properties can be added to each individual color through embedding glyphs on a single surface of the block (the top surface). Using the previous example, an icon may represent a specific kind of data transformation (e.g. normalization). 

**DEGREE 3: attributes**

Attributes allow introduction of more granular properties to blocks, and are presented on one or both sides of block. An example would be repeating a process represented by a block several times. 

**DEGREE 4: arguments**

Arguments behave in the same way as say python function arguments. An example of an attribute would be to allow changing default values, or provide other specifics (e.g. normalize data to max 1). An arbitrary number of arguments is supported for each block. Arguments live inside the block and do not change the physical appearance of the block.

**DEGREE 5: code**

Complete transparency and arbitrary configurability is provided for builders and advanced users through providing access to the underlying source codes of a block. Note that the codes reflect the functionality associated with the block.
